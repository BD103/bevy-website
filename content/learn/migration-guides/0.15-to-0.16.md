{% callout(type="warning") %}
This guide is currently for a __Release Candidate__ and is subject to change as we work on and improve it. If you notice any errors or issues within this guide, then please submit an issue at [the Bevy website repository issue tracker](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/issues).
{% end %}

The most important changes to be aware of this release are:

- Bevy now prefers `Result`s over panicking, as applications can easily recover from `Result`s instead of crashing. As part of this decision, Bevy's error handling capabilities have been significantly improved. (Systems can easily return `Result`s and a new `BevyError` type has been introduced.) Additionally, several panicking functions have been switched to return a result (`Query::single()`) or have been deprecated completely (`Query::many()`).
